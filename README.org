** FAQ
*** Q.  Do you support proprietary software?
A. Partially, yes.

I am a supporter of the Free Software Movement.
However, since I am a lazy programmer, I know that the IDE's support can save
a lot of time and effort.  Proprietary software is unethical, but some of them are
powerful and practical.  The IDEs are a bit lacking in the charm of hacking.
I would like to increase the time we spend lazily away from business
by interoperating them.

When the practical development environment is completed by free softwares,
I will stop recommending you to proprietary software.
