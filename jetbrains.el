;;; Commentary:

;; Jetbrains IDEs and Emacs are best friend!
;;
;; ## Support IDEs
;;
;; - Android Studio: `studio'
;; - AppCode: `appcode'
;; - CLion: `clion'
;; - Gogland: `gogland'
;; - IntelliJ IDEA: `idea'
;; - PhpStorm: `pstorm'
;; - PyCharm: `charm'
;; - Rider: `rider'
;; - RubyMine: `mine'
;; - WebStorm: `wstorm'
;;
;; ## Setup
;;
;; Please run `Tools > Create Command-line Launcher...' by menu in your IDE.
;;
;;
;; ### .dir-locals.el
;;
;; I encourage you to create a `.dir-locals.el` file in your project.
;;
;;     ((nil . (jetbrains-ide "PhpStorm")))
;;
;; ### Interoperability
;;
;; You can return to Emacs from the IDE.
;; Please see follows article: "Quick Tip: Getting Emacs and IntelliJ to play together"
;; https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/03/emacs-intellij/
;;
;; ## FAQ
;;
;; ### Q.  Do you support proprietary software?
;;
;; A. Partially, yes.
;;
;; I am a supporter of the Free Software Movement.
;; However, since I am a lazy programmer, I know that the IDE's support can save
;; a lot of time and effort.  Proprietary software is unethical, but some of them are
;; powerful and practical.  The IDEs are a bit lacking in the charm of hacking.
;; I would like to increase the time we spend lazily away from business
;; by interoperating them.
;;
;; When the practical development environment is completed by free softwares,
;; I will stop recommending you to proprietary software.
